POLITICS ELEVATED PLATFORM
Economic Prosperity & Reduce Inflation
 January will aggressively combat inflation by implementing technology to eliminate the national debt & solve operational breakdowns in the USA supply chain. This will ease the pain on Utahn wallets. Resulting in lower gas prices and affordable groceries.

Drought & Sustainability
     Hydroflume Technology will help reduce farming water usage by 12%, & January's proposal on using blockchain technology will allow water to be tracked across states and provide a path to reducing water waste.

Personal Privacy & Cybersecurity
As illustrated in the Bill of Rights, data privacy is a human right.  

You should have full control over your personal data & not be a product of big data. As we transition to a fully digital world.  Solutions like Blockchain Identity Wallets will allow individuals,  to control their information and vote securely with Blockchain Voting in elections.

Clean Air to Breathe for Utah
Every person deserves to breathe clean air. Our current representatives have power and influence but haven't done enough to help the pollution. Securing clean air resources to Utah will be a major focus for January. 

Housing Availability for All Budgets
High housing prices have become a barrier to entry for buyers & renters. Hardworking Utahns who have been able to afford housing struggle to do so and are becoming displaced. January will support programs to bring affordability back to Utah.

Work Life Balance & Paid Time Off
The pandemic showed us that our work-life balance was unsustainable, and we're seeing labor leave the workforce. Overwhelming feedback from Utahns indicate a need for guaranteed PTO for sickness & relaxation. January will seek this for all workers.

Reasonable Healthcare Pricing & Prevention
The United States spends its money on the outcomes of unmanaged illness rather than early prevention and intervention. January will champion initiatives that create "health now" to save money on healthcare costs downstream & reduce costs today on American wallets.

Fiscal Responsibility & Budget
It is immoral to leave future generations trillions in debt. January will lead  new solutions to prevent government shut downs and spend tax payer dollars prudently, & work towards eliminating the national debt.

Education Reform & Affordability
Education costs are a barrier to entry for the future success of not only individuals but the USA as a whole. January will work on a multifaceted plan to reduce education costs & support teachers.

Criminal Justice Reform
Nearly one in three Utahns have some kind of a criminal record. January will take the first steps towards meaningful reform by removing minimum prison sentences at the federal level.

High Paying Part Time Work
Creating Jobs that are high paying part time work mobilizes a highly educated workforces of stay at home parents while allowing them to continue care for children.

Term Limits
Enough said.

PERSONAL STANCES
Women's Healthcare Access
January does not support government mandated childbirth or laws that limit women's access to birth control. Especially in cases of rape, incest, and at the risk of health and safety of the woman. She does support laws that support preventative healthcare for both men & women, and protects partners from violence. 

LGBTQ+
January believes in "Liberty & Justice for All" and that individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ should be treated with acceptance, compassion, and respect.  Countries are stronger when all people -- regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics -- are fully recognized as free and equal members of their society.

Capitalism
January is a capitalist, or as she likes to say "a capitalist with heart." She believes in contributing to society and taking care of our nation's health. January focuses on pragmatic legislation that restores the middle class and helps raise the lower class. 

2nd Amendment
January supports the right to firearms and champions technology solutions to prevent unauthorized individuals from utilizing a firearm without permission. She is dedicated to implementing immediate & collaborative solutions to eliminate gun violence across the United States.

Why January Walker?
 In the private sector, January is a business standout with a career as a product manager. She currently leads software development teams that create solutions to protect the privacy and identity of consumers. In the past, she has created products that have grossed $100M+.



Like many of you, January has wanted a better choice of candidates. She expected political leaders who would actively put people before party, champion constituent needs, and actually represent the people.



She recognized that she couldn't expect other leaders to step forward if she wasn't willing to do so herself, and frequently considered running for office. In 2021, she took the initial step by kicking off a listening campaign around the state to find out what was most important to Utahns & how to best represent them.



 She has the talent, the skillset, and the ability to lead the next generations towards a better future. For her, this is Politics Elevated.

WE CAN'T KEEP ELECTING THE SAME PARTIES AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS.
January Walker

Politically, we are all a shade of purple and have a lot in common. What we agree on, in fact, overlaps by at least 80%. We should focus on the 80% instead of partisan politics & the tribalism that sow division and put us into gridlock. 

VOTE FOR JANUARY!


40% of Utah is Moderate. We deserve to have a voice and be represented.
